I just ran across a passage that gave me a powerful __Aha!__ moment, which is this: 
> I'm not wholly against making money. But i think there are ethical concerns. Lets say... we invent the Star Trek replicator. Finally - goods can be made out of thin air. Food can be made out of thin air. Replicators would be a scarcity destroying machine with the possibility of both destroying labor AND ending world hunger. It'd be a major shift for society. But insert the corporation and the capitalist who would wrap this machine's usage up in license fees, laws restricting usage, etc.. They would use it to destroy labor, but they would prevent the device from destroying scarcity. It's too threatening to the power structures that control capital. You'll never technologically innovate yourself out of the exploitation of capitalism. Never. There is no capitalist path to a post scarcity world.

Said differently:
Capitalism, a system which attempts to distribute scarce goods opitmally, pesrists in spaces where scarcity isn't the rule and _imposes that scarcity upon them._


Read the post in it's entireity [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1xip1s/is_amazon_bad_for_books_george_packer/cfbp9pg?context=1).


If the goal is to optimally distribute goods to the individuals in society, artificial scarcity surely can't be helping. 

If we cannot hope that we can innovate our way out of the capitalist paradigm, then how may we hope to create society that is adopted to abundance and can distribute this abundance to  provide basic human rights to all?

This is a really interesting idea, and one I want to mull over, partially because it's a heavy topic, partially because I may have been wrong. 

Previously I thought that scarce energy resources are the main limit to health and human achievement.  
Given virtually limitless (clean) energy, it would be easy to ensure universal access to clean water, artificial light, and toilets. This would change the world &mdash; about 50% of us have never used a toilet. _(citation needed)_

The manufacturing of artificial scarcity really throws a monkey wrench in this line of utopian thinking.  I just want kids to stop dying of diarrhea. 


Maybe we don't need unlimited energy to change this- maybe it wouldn't make a difference if we did.
