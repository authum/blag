I've found myself here over the long weekend and finally have a lazy monday to chill on the couch with a friend and catch up.
We're talking about things that we've experienced together. I'm listening to tales of life in Paris and Belgium. 
She found Belgium horrible (I've never been). She found kareaoke bars and a closed culture not accepting different groups. 

While working in the Belgian Concertgebow, Keish and her partner couldn't understand the Flemish spoken by the Macedonians
with whom they were working.  The experience was isolating, but she enjoyed 6 months of Bikram yoga.
At this point I'm narrating a conversation like a stenographer.   *Pause.*

###&hellip;

So I'm now back on my flight, and taking pictures as we watch teh sunset off the starbord side, where the clouds are lazily forming 
 &mdash;  stratus, and stratocumulus dividers that change the look of the countryside as we climb out and fly above them. 

Through the caramel and orange, cool twiting blues and purples of the sunset, and fading burnt sienna
a dot &mdash; sharp edged and fast-moving passes from 3 to 6 o clock, right in front of the top edge of the cloud front.

It's swept back wings show up against the orange tinge as it climbs out, tracing a line that rapidly passes my field of vision.
The rate at which is changes it's relative position is astonishing.  Unable to give a speed I can say it traces out an arc that 
increases in measure by thirty degrees a second. Though smaller than the sliver moon, it seems to be moving past as an object 
very near to the aircraft as it whips past like the nearby sign on the highway.  

The familiar timbre of Castillian spanish passes through the cabin, followed by thickly accented English, 
and there is true peace onboard the aircraft.   

The weekend we have spent together has been hectic, in that there were a million things that have been done and seen, 
few photos and little journaling done to combat the onset of forgetfulness.  

As I had discussed over wine before leaving, my mind perhaps is not a steel trap, as much as I remenisice on the past it comes to me 
hazily, detaials forgotten,  
along with their forgetting.  

I return with an overdue book of poetry unread, and experiences untold -- Experiences which will remain unpublished  

turning over in my head, like the slow drifting eddies that follow a a deep ship in the marina, idling as it makes no wake.  

I'm now watching as the teal clouds turn a darker shade of blue, and the electric blue of the sky above belies the fading of the day.  

From holes in the cloudbank at the foot of the window appear the dull yelowish lights of some city below.  
Perhaps it is Paris, given the time.  It's streets and industrial parks appear hazy through the cloud, then break into clarity,
like the reflections of the dew on a cobweb during the middle of the night. Soon these visions are lost, swallowed up once again into
the roiling clouds.  The cabin is filled with the muffled sound of the high-bibass turbines moving &mdash; like the nighttime crash 
of small waves on the distant beach - but without the intermediate lull or stacatto attack.  It's just one long delay, sustain, release.
Briefly the staccato s and sh sounds of conversation reach my hearing, the only parts able to survive the gauntlet of distance and noise-
a reminder that there are others on this flight.  

I'm not alone, but enveloped in the sanctuary of soothing sounds and visions happy memories and high spirits.
This trip was anything but the expected, all told.  
I spent little time with Jazz, but the time I did was very fun. She is the quintissential woman, oft mythologized.  

<!--We talk of missed connections and future plans. I hear more of what it is to be in a relationship, who wears the pants, and we speak of 
the types of relationships that men and women have, straight, gay, lesbian. We speak of the oddities of the night &mdash; how one girl was
found to have been more hetero than thought previously, contrary to the expectations of those acquainted to her.   
-->
Presently I think on the bright green squares of color, unimaginably bright, unimaginably large &mdash;   
In the middle of canals, fields and ponds, a few city blocks of perfect rectilinear green light.  
Slowly, thin slivers are being turned off, second by second. It is a clock, perhaps. What is it doing, miles from any town?  

Who would pay for such a waste of energy? No signs &mdash; Is it just a passing amusement, some millionaire's flight of fancy?  
The thing passes and is gone. And the sky is darker than before.  

In Amsterdam, I met one woman.  Tasked with an errand for friends, she was a part of a wild goose chase, and I passed briefly through her
apartment. Perhaps I should have stayed a while, gotten to know this person better, somone so open as to invite me up after meeting me 
five minutes ago, as an intermediate stop on the way to a shared destination. Ah, but these are the most interesting excursions.

It's a shame the story was so anticlimactic.  

I had explored the Van Gogh Museum swaying to the thump of a DJ spinning lounge music on the bottom floor
in a local musicians' showcase.  
The exhibit began chronologically &mdash; reknowned paintings taking up the floor space at the bottom, and showcasing some of his most
famous works.  Winding upstairs, I found more art, more styles awaiting me, far from the abstraction of before.  

First, some of his early work was heavy in earth tones and heavy brushstrokes; used heavy light and immense dark mass of earth
which stretched out before the canvas to meet the darkening sky, interrupted only by the bright stripe of sunset.
Peasant women collecting potatoes in the muddy fields.  The lowlands of rainy Holland.

Then the artists residence he had imagined as a community, whose membership would never surpass two, a cheerful yellow house,
of two stories.  Here a new techinque &mdash; fine lines, lighter oils, the wet-on-wet left back in the mud of the previous room. Then came
some portarits, of others, and self-portraits &mdash; some on reused canvases from earlier. Then there were the sunflowers &mdash; stolen away to
a temporary exhibit. 

Next came the later, and the larger format works: orchards, fields, and thunderclouds over wheat fields.  The latter reminded me heavily
of the plains of Spain, and returing to Madrid from a weekend in Sevilla accompanied by Salim, watching the rivers, hills and bright
green of spring, blue sky and scattered cumulus.  One to put on the wall, a vision of peace and bounty.

After that, methods, chemistry, and forensics: The perspective tools used by Van Gogh (He couldn't draw that well either?!), 
his meditaitons on the use of contrasts and how the works seen previously had changed.  Van Gogh's studes in color theory 
directed his art, and his still lives and portaits made use of contrast to create bold paintings, which have become drab with time-
due to the varnish coloring, and the reds fading. The interplay of purple and green was now lost (and simulated in recreations). 

Later, there were stereoscopes with copies of different parts of the paintings &mdash; revealing the depth of the paint, and intermixing 
that was present in the layers of paint found on his canvases.  The signs pointed to more than twenty on some. 

Finally, a new artist, known for his dramatic woodcuts and risque and critical paintings of man and woman dominated the upper floors, 
with dramatized pictures of the front, and charactures of the Parisian high society. The very last works on display were almost photorealistic
portraits done with very fine detail set against an almost featureless background, which lept out of the canvas and seemed to breathe,
each strand of hair almost beginning to move as I swayed to the distant beat wafting up from three floors below. It was time to roll.


I had finished combing over every last piece of artwork in the museum, and connected up with my friends, 
we prepared a rendzevous in the hotel in Amstelplatz, but first I was tasked with finding drinks on the way. 

Walking through Museumplein back in that direction, I looked to no avail, and began to see the shutters dropping on storefronts.
The place I had been directed towards never materialized, so I asked a passerby.  Luckily, she too was going to get some, and 
offered to show me where.
