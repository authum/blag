So I installed the Vim syntax highlighter for Markdown posts! Lordy be! I'm now able to see mostly what my text looks like. The Vim website had a couple versions by different people dating back to 2009, which is a bit older than what I was expecting. Anyway, [here's the link for the one I'm using.](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2882) So far so good. That's enough development for today.

As far as the rest goes, I have recently chagned the name of said blog, from appreciation (with all due respect to the community which has made the creation of something like this blog such a triviality, in particular the [tutorial](www.neverstopbuilding.com/jekyll-slim-compass-blog) by Jason Fox. Since I'm cheap *and* lazy, I've been writing this in a [cloud-based IDE](https://www.nitrous.io/join/YsN1AzfsZTE?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral) and pushing over to [Heroku's](heroku.com) free hosting, with a backup on [github](github.com/authum). It's pretty slick. 

<!-- At this point, I have changed the name to cntmplt, following all them young whipper-snappers thinking that vowels are just too passÃ©.  The name hopefully refelects the point of this work, which 
dips its toes into the configuration of this blog to a much greater level than Wordpress or Blogger's free tier, with the added bonus that I'm using a static site which in theory means that the thing loads faster for all you folks out there.  But that's not the true reason for all this.  -->
I really built this blog to build a platform upon which I can develop my ideas and hopefully submit them to criticism, a platform that is as pleasant for people to look at as possible. Specifically, my harebraned musings on life, the universe, and everything. 

Part of this is bred from a disaffection for my present mode of earning an income, namely teaching English abroad. Don't get me wrong, the ability to be around eager students and the challenge to create intellectually stimulating material while meanwhile adopting a whole new skillset, language, and culture has be a blast. I am also glad that the work has kept me on my feet instead of bent over a computer all day.  Both of these things will most likely serve me well in the future.  Regardless, I have increasingly felt the pull towards a more esoteric, perhaps more politically charged position. I'm currently in the midst of self-doubt regarding this aspiration, both for the possibility that it may indicate an ego in metastasis, and that I will fail, due to lack of volition, gumption or stick-to-it-iveness. (Did I spell that last one right?) But that's not enough reason not to go for something. 

Now here is the first in a series of posts that attempt to flesh out the path by which I have arrived at this goal. It may take a while.

Over the past few years, I've gotten quite taken with the idea of nuclear power. Now, don't get me wrong. I was the kid who read Popular Mechanics in the library, and the Sierra Club newsletter at home. I studied the effects of climate change and took part in a mock summit on the same in 2006, and during this time I went to see An Inconvenient Truth in theatres. But the fix is in, and there really haven't been enough convincing numbers from the Greens as far as energy resource availability is concerned to make a case that we can depend on renewables to take care of our needs in any meaningful way, even if you apply the falling cost of solar cells, and disregard the environmental toll that their manufacture wreaks. 

I remember watching youtube videos about Peak Oil and looking at the boom in shale and tar sand exploration with grim resignation. As our expanding population and universal hope for an increased standard of living met up with the reality of the depletion of low-hanging fruit in the energy sector, the road to a future powered by renewables seemed to me one that would likely be going dowhill in my lifetime; paved by the tarry asphalt of long-chain hydrocarbons and some atrociously impure coal. Alberta and Beijing both are bearing witness to these suspicions, and the proposed fix of "clean coal" and CO2 capture and sequester really hasn't taken off.  Meanwhile, the realpolitik that comes into play when we are faced with an increasingly energy-constrained society has lead us into the quagmire of Iraq and the more recent Ukraine embroglio, with the added wrinkle of strenthening ties between Russia and China as energy and manufacturing behemoths, respectively. As far as I know, this also spells bad news for the long-term feasibility of the US Dollar as a reserve currency, as the United States' economic and military power seems daily to be brought into greater question. 

 As far as natural resources go, domestic reserves of oil are mostly confined to the the kinds of fields that only operate productively for a short time, and have comparitively terrible EROEI numbers.  New discovery could perhaps alter this a bit, but one wonders how long before you get to and EROEI of unity. My gut feeling is that won't last 'till midcentury, but I'll accept the possibility that I am wrong, given that this whole oil thing really isn't my area of expertise. 

Regardless, combine an iffy energy situation with a military power that's increasingly facing some pretty embarassing news (How about Iran's hijacking of the prototype US drowe, amirite?) and I think that the days of fed tapering can't be forestalled forever. At some point things are probably going to change in a big way, and I'm not sure that will be anywhere near pretty. 

I would posit that the standard of living of a people is directly related to the amount of energy that they consume, and this energy is what serves as the main foundation that ensures things like reliable fresh drinking water, a functioning food system (that's a subject for another day), advanced medical care, transporation, and manufacturing. In short, the stuff that we really are loathe to do without. In essence, this is the reason why I think that the traditonal approach to climate change is a flawed one: we are just not going to give up our warm showers willingly. 

A few might, but those visionarys are never going to become the majority or even make a dent in the numbers. Although supposedly they'll have better circulation, those who choose to do things the "old-fashioned way" and consume less will probably have a hard time convincing the rest of us, and while the goal may be a noble return to a more meaningful life, rooted in craft and connection to people, culture and place, I ultimately view this as wrongheaded. And I've been there too, fairly. I'm still pro-permaculture, yet GMO-agnostic (Still haven't gotten into the literature enough to draw any meaningful conclusions), but I have worked on organic farms and was not convinced the lifestyle would prove attractive enough to enough of us to take it on, barring further stagnation in the prospects of college-educated white-collar employment, or even the hollowing-out of traditional industry and the hyper-specialization that high per-capita energy use has brought to the developed nations. 

Even so, if no further action is taken, I see things headed in that direction. When that happens we'll probably see the internet generation made irrelevant by a breakdown in the modes of work became dominant during the rise of industrial society. Now'd be good time to get started on that farm plot methinks, due to an increasingly depressing labor prospects, price inflation and the looming threat of havoc now that climate change is beginning to gear up. 

For a time I was ready to welcome in this eventuality, as it would serve as a reminder to the ultimate foolishness of the human attempt to conquer nature, a return to simpler pleasures, and hopefully serve as a limit to the amount of damage that it could serve to the biosphere. Unfortunately, estimates of available nonconventional oil, coal and natural gas cast that last one into doubt, but I have changed my mind for [other reasons.] (https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/throwback-thursday-the-truth-about-asteroids-9d66f1c2a103)
