So I managed to get the blog back, and how I did it was by killing the Heroku Apps. I had attempted to make one app point to another, and I'm pretty sure that created a conflict inside Heroku. I'm not patient enough to figure out how to rename my app correctly, so I just deleted it and uploaded all the content to the one I had my eye on. That was much easier. And we're back.	


###Let's look at the future of our climate! 

The following are some of the things I learned &mdash; mostly way back in 2006 midway through high-school.
  
Due to various causes, the arctic has been heating up much more rapidly than areas in the temperate lattitudes, which spells [bad news](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL051000/abstract;jsessionid=DE399DAB6C52D29A4DC4CEE2FDB20AB4.d02t02).  One of the most haunting statistics that I remember from the Geography course I took was that the albedo (reflectivity) of ice is above 99%, and that of vegetated land was closer to 70%.  What that means is that there would be a more than 70x increase in energy absorbed per square unit of land as the glaciers and permafrost above it melted away; this heat would then go on to heat our atmosphere. If we combine this with the positive feedback caused by the release of methane from anerobic digestion of long-frozen organic matter previously stored in the permafrost, as poles of the earth warm up, we could be in for a [really](http://energybc.ca/cache/climatechange/www.aibs.org/bioscience-press-releases/resources/Schuur.pdf) [wild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_amplification) ride.  If this organic matter represents a carbon sink equal in size to that which is comprised of our fossil fuels, we can look at a double-jeapordy effect of greenhouse gasses, wherein each kilogram of carbon that's burned as natural gas, coal or petroleum ends up as perhaps double that amount. But then there's also the [fact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_methane_release) that being in a waterlogged swampy area, the bacteria that decompose this material and return it to the atmosphere will not be able to do so in the presence of oxygen, and thus will create CH4 instead of CO2; a greenhouse gas that's 20x more potent as a greenhouse gas. 

As an increasing greenhouse effect causes sea surface temperatures to rise, and the aforementioned melt [weakens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation) the theromahaline current, tropical storms will continue to increase in magnitude and frequency.  Combine this with increased seasonal variation in weather patterns and I can foresee a lot of failed crops in the near future. Maybe those scrappy and resourceful enough to bring a crop to market will be able to make great returns, but this means that everyone else will have to earmark much more for food expenditures in their budget. Oh, and did I mention that water will also be [more](http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article141.html) of a [worry](http://www.businessinsider.com/map-the-worlds-water-scarcity-problem-is-bad-and-getting-worse-2014-5) as well?

And you thought reading The Stranger was enough to make you a nihilist.
