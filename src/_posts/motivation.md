Nobel prizewinner, Richard Smalley became known for his lectures in which he would ask his audience to name the 10 biggest problems humanity would have to face in the next 50 years. His answer to the question was divided into the following categories, in order of importance: energy, water, food, environment, poverty, war, disease, education, democracy, and population.  Smalley’s answer put energy at the top, as he argued energy security is required for a people to be able to address the following categories. The reason for this is that the choices we make about our energy future will have an impact on our water and food situation, all of which influence the other factors.  In this way, energy can be thought of as one of the keystones upon which the arch of our society rests upon. 

With electricity, one can dig canals, run pumps and even purify seawater.  Food supplies can then be expanded through infrastructure projects to use these water resources for irrigation, and energy to create things such as fertilizers. Finally, climate change occurring due to human population expansion affects water and food availability, and depends completely on the choices we make in the energy realm. 

Energy, water, food.  These three factors taken together do much to predict the long-term stability of a place.  In 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi became the latest witness to this claim. A Tunisian street food vendor who self-immolated in a protest of rising food prices and a corrupt autocratic regime, Bouazizi sparked the revolution in Tunisia that would later spread to the wider region and become known as the Arab Spring. 

Following a 2011 report, the events were likely connected to the high price of food, which in turn was possibly caused by a combination of speculation, and the use of corn for cellulosic ethanol production in the US, a case where a rich country continues to maintain a vehicle fleet and in so doing causes food shortages in the world at large. Again, the issues of political instability, food and energy are more closely linked than I had ever thought.  As Bar-Yam et al. describe the situation, 
“... individuals depend on a political system for adequate decision making to guarantee expected standards of survival.”

When basic goods and services become unobtainable, public support breaks down.  War, terrorism, and revolution can be seen through this lens not as a product of political ideology as much as a symptom of societal failure to ensure the wellbeing of its constituent citizens.  In an increasingly global market where food prices affect the ability of the planet’s poor to survive, the adverse effects of climate-driven natural disasters, drought, and energy shortage can create violence that spreads in a ripple effect to other countries around the globe.  At the moment, ISIS, an extremist branch of fighters based in Iraq and Syria, have been fighting the governments of both states, events symptomatic of a long-term breakdown in the ability of these areas to form a political system that can guarantee the expected standards of survival. 

This contagion is too deadly to merely attack via counter-terrorism operations, the root cause of this violence must be eradicated. Only when this is done will the extremist rhetoric fade from the discourse to which we constantly bear witness emanating from the Middle East. If we are unable to satisfy the energy demands of the world in the near future, these incidents will not go away.  If the future holds a greater degree of resource scarcity, a greater incidence of catastrophic weather events, and emergent water shortages, these occurrences will likely become more commonplace.  If we want to ensure democracy and avoid war, we must ensure abundance. 

But beyond protecting ourselves from external threats, we also have to take into consideration the real and current needs of our planet’s population, especially the 4 billion people living at the the levels of extreme and moderate poverty.  Those suffering from extreme poverty suffer from vulnerability to water shortages and no electricity, the rest have issues of future water shortages, and little electricity available.  

As the case of China shows us, a largely rural population can become wealthy and consume vast amounts of energy in a short time; thus any future estimates of electricity demand must reflect the increasing material standards of the world’s poor.  Currently, most estimates of future energy demand largely do not seem to factor changing quality-of-life into future demand. 

Assuming that we work to bring the world average energy consumption (a useful indicator for other quality-of-life metrics) to the levels of a country like Bulgaria, world energy use would increase around 100%, to bring it to the level of a country like Germany, a 200% increase in current energy consumption would be required.  

According to the 2014 EIA Annual Energy Outlook, current demand is set to increase by 56 percent, with the majority of this growth occurring in non-OECD countries, and mostly in fossil fuel expansion.  Again, this is nowhere near what would be required to bring about a more desirable state of affairs for humanity, due to this falling short of what would be considered a reasonable living standard for the world’s population, and due to the undeniable negative impact that the expansion of fossil fuel use would have. 

There is another important factor to be added here, which is that in order to adhere to the recommendations by the IPCC and limit human carbon dioxide emissions to tolerable levels, we would have to replace 80% of our current energy supplies with carbon-neutral sources, and all future sources.  Scylla, meet Charybdis. Most likely the populations in non-OECD countries will not be able to afford carbon-neutral technologies and renewables, nevermind the OECD countries.  They will most likely shun the more expensive technologies and will instead suffer the consequences of pollution if alternatives are not found that can compete on a cost basis. 

Without these alternatives, the use of more impure fossil fuel sources and the attendant environmental degradation that will follow is a near-certainty, given the reality that countries like China and others in the developing world present us with.  The risk that this represents to the planet is not to be discounted, and while we may be able to meet our energy demands in this manner, we put our food and water supplies at risk by doing so. 

One may argue that all these problems have been brought on by the overexpansion of the human population, and claim that we need to fix this first, but global population will likely peak around mid-century at around ten billion people.  This would be an increase of roughly 40 percent, so  this too will have to be factored in.  Again, like most projected energy demand increase, this population increase has been predicted to lie in these non-OECD countries, and the reasons for this are clear: countries with a low HDI are those where the most uncertainty lies, where education is not rewarded and where the effort of ensuring day-to-day survival dominate the lives of their citizens. This uncertainty is what drives individuals to have larger families, as many will die from inadequate medical treatment and lack of access to clean water, and the need for help in subsistence agriculture. Were these conditions to change, the population problem would cease to exist, and this would do much to reduce poverty and gender inequality worldwide. 

Whether from carbon-neutral sources or not, our energy consumption is going to increase worldwide in the coming decades. We are in a position to choose these sources, and I believe that nuclear power is the most desirable option.  I see this is as the most pertinent issue to our society at present, and it is for this reason that I wish to make an impact by working to further the expansion of the nuclear sector and develop new technologies to solve the problems of this century.  I hope that my background has prepared me, yet where it has not I am more than willing to do what it takes to come up to speed; at this point I am inspired. 


While I believe we should be able to determine our level of material involvement, the idea that this would condemn a larger part of the world’s population to live in extreme poverty haunted me.  Not knowing the the reality of the energy situation, I hoped for change from activism, treaties and accords, yet as time went on it seemed to me to be the case that the aforementioned problems continued to be avoided.  The issues of future crises were danced around in a sickening game of musical chairs; a game where the losers in the game would be devastated, and those who escaped the carnage watched in horror without seeing the warning that their position was by no means secure.  

Following the predictions of those in the Peak Oil movement, it seemed in a way poetic that we should have been granted the wealth of the planet only to squander it before we knew just how precious it was. Previous to informing myself of the possibilities of nuclear power, I had lived as one in a slow moving accident, hoping for a deus-ex-machina to appear, transfixed by the ever-more-dire predictions made by authorities on the future of our planet.  

I thought the answer to our looming problems could be found in the past: de-industrialization and a step back into a world recognizable to our ancestors, or at least something a lot closer to their own.  A bucolic society, one which had been forced to abandon speed, convenience, and thereby gained community, a sense of place.   For a time this seemed like the answer; it was, at least, a wholesome seeming respite from the realities of our present reality, and an apt response to it.  

I remember having held, deep down, a sense of resignation, a sense of dread; That the carefree days of my past and present would never be something I could guarantee to those who would come after me, and a hardscrabble life was what waited for me and those to follow me.  

At a certain point along the way I found out about a book which mentioned the MSR breeder reactor, and the promise of next-generation fission energy to ensure the material security of our planet, and it was then that I turned away from my fear. 

I want to be a part of something big, something important, whose impact will be lauded by future generations. I hope that my work improves the lote of the people all over the world, irrespective of their circumstances. I want to ensure the possibility of happy, productive lives not only in the future of those in my family and those around me, but also in the future of the families I will never meet &mdash; families locked out of possible advancement by present circumstances. I hope for an egalitarian world, a post carbon world, and I can only see this dream becoming a reality via the development of nuclear power. 

I feel that I must do what I can to make this happen, and the best way I can apply myself to these ends seems to be that I further educate myself in the technology to its very core, and work to bring it forth as the most safe, most abundant and revolutionary energy source I know it to be.
