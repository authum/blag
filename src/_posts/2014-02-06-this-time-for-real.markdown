[I am invincible!](http://youtu.be/cKO0RrM7LvI)

Ok, not really, but this is the line that comes to mind when my mind has been turned into putty, and despite this unfortunate happenstance I somehow managed to publish this site to Heroku last night, and only a half hour later than the time by which I had planned to be in bed. Unfortunately, there were no nonplussed coworkers around to roll their eyes at such a pronouncement, especially given the prosaic nature of my feat. But it has been arduous enough for me. Since last we talked, I got myself throughly wrapped up in Git and the Heroku Toolbelt. Git, a project of none other than Linus Torvalds, is a tool which I had viewed with apprehension and now holds much promise to make my life a heck of a lot less painful, both in the context of the development of this website and in, well, any other project that involves digital storage. It is a system by which one can make many versions of a file, track and manage changes, and even collaborate, changing different bits simultaneously, while keeping a complete record of the file's history. Gone are the days of 

-  paper rough draft 
-  paper rough draftA 
-  paper rough draftB
-  paper-lessroughdraft 
-  pagadhser 
-  this is so wrong! 
-  arrrghhhh

and so forth. [*or so I hope*](http://www.xkcd.com/1296) 

Beyond that, well, who's to say.
