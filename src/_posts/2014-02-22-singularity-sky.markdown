I just finished up reading Charles Stross' _Singularity Sky_, which began with 
> The day war was declared, a rain of telephones fell clattering to the cobblestones from the skies above 
Novy Petrograd. Some of them had half melted in the heat of re-entry; others pinged and ticked, cooling 
rapidly in the postdawn chill. An inquisitive pigeon hopped close, head cocked to one side; it pecked at 
the shiny case of one such device, then fluttered away in alarm when it beeped. A tinny voice spoke: 
&quot;Hello? Will you entertain us?&quot;

The second book by Stross I've read, _Sky_ draws you in with a fantastic view of the future, focused particularly on 
two bands of diametrically opposed cultures returning in contact after the post-singularity exodus off planet Earth.

The book explores some consequences of the existance of a slew of technologies such as the "cornocopia machine". 
With the ability to manufacture items on the molecular level and blueprints for every object in the history of humanity on file (including the machine itself), 
it's a grapefruit-sized object with some serious sociopolitial reprecurssions.  

In the story, humanity has become a spacefaring species, and interstellar travel and has developed a half-dozen or so methods to travel
near to or faster than light speed.  The reprecussions of such travel are explored in depth. 

Following the theory of relativity, objects that travel faster than the speed of light will arrive before any trace of their departure has 
been able to reach you. Much as a distant sniper's near miss is first noticed as a cloud of dust kicked up in a nearby wall is followed by the distant report of the firearm a half-second later. 

The inclusion of this phenomena is interesting since it creates serious wrinkles in the standard space-travel protocol, 
and has serious implications for communication and warfare.  Since light (or radio, or whatever) is travelling at a fixed velocity, any communication
or interaction between distant points (be they within a solar system or interstellar) will have a certain amount of lag time. **[\*](#note)**
  

Naturally, there's a getaround: the physical transport of entangled quantum systems which obey faster-than-light communication. Devices carry one set of entangled qbits to one point, and
by changing their state, the state of each sister bit changes instantaneously, however far the pair be separated.  As far as I know, current research may be putting the plausibilty of faster-than-light
(*herein referred to as FTL*) communication into question, but for the purposes of evading some of the larger potholes in typical sci-fi the trick works well. 

But, you may be thinking, Why not just send messages faster than light, if people can do so? A hand-delivered telegram that arrives on your doorstep the moment it leaves (or even some time before) is just as easy, right? 
I could answer that one, but I think it's best you read the book to find out.

Equal parts technical and whimsical, Stross shows that the future has a sense of humor.  I am reminded of his last work I read, *[Accelerando](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando.html)*,
wherein one of the characters was a sentient assembly of lobster neurons put to work managing an early deep-space mining sattelite. I find it both refreshing, and plausible enough to keep me entertained without loosing my sense of disbeleif. 
It's not as ponderous as my focus on the tech in the book makes it out to be.  In fact, I found it eminently readable: the 300 odd pages were finished in about two days. When I read a book that fast, it's usually due to a mix of enrapturing ideas, a strong 
cast of characters, and a sense of urgency that grabs you and doesn't let you go till the finish.  Now I just want to see the future, traveling time the old-fashioned way &mdash; by living to see it.

### <a name="note"></a> [__\*__](#note)
 At a distance of 1 AU, the Earth recieves light from the sun with a lag time of 8 minutes (being 8 light-seconds away). If, as you are reading this, the sun were to disappear, you have 8 minutes to light a candle, but you wouldn't know that yet. 

 At interstellar distances, things are measured in light-years. Alpha Centauri, our nearest neighbor, would recieve communications from us more than four years after their departure. This is like, 16th century turnaround times, and it's our best-case scenario with current technology. Also, that signal will take a heck of a lot of power to transmit...
